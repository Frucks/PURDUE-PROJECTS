# PURDUE-PROJECTS

Hi!

If you're seeing this I probably applied to your company. These projects are from all my coding classes, excluding labs (VPython, Verilog, Assembly) and CS 159 (C Programming).


## Advanced C Programming (ECE 264)

The projects for this class are the ones that start with "hw". The earlier ones familiarized us with simpler concepts such as gcc, makefiles and sorting algorithms, but as the course progressed they got more complex, ending with stacks, recursion and binary trees.

My personal favorite was Homework 11. In this assignment, the goal was to traverse a maze and build a sorted linked list with all possible routes. To accomplish this I had to use recursion, which is always fun to think about, as well as different structures (including enum).
